## About Cosmic Unicorn

Cosmic Unicorn offers 32x32 bright RGB LEDs driven by Pico W's PIO in addition to a 1W amplifier + speaker, a collection of system and user buttons, and two Qw/ST connectors for adding external sensors and devices. Woha!

Cosmic Unicorn ships with MicroPython firmware pre-loaded, but you can download the most recent version at the link below (you'll want the  `cosmic-unicorn` image).

- [MicroPython releases](https://github.com/pimoroni/pimoroni-pico/releases)

## Cosmic Unicorn and PicoGraphics

The easiest way to start displaying cool stuff on Cosmic Unicorn is using our Cosmic Unicorn module (which contains a bunch of helpful functions for interacting with the buttons, adjusting brightness and suchlike) and our PicoGraphics library, which is chock full of useful functions for drawing on the LED matrix.

- [Cosmic Unicorn function reference](../../modules/cosmic_unicorn/README.md)
- [PicoGraphics function reference](../../modules/picographics/README.md)

## Examples

### Clock

[clock.py](clock.py)

Clock example with (optional) NTP synchronization. You can adjust the brightness with LUX + and -, and resync the time by pressing A.

### Eighties Super Computer

[eighties_super_computer.py](eighties_super_computer.py)

Random LEDs blink on and off mimicing the look of a movie super computer doing its work in the eighties. You can adjust the brightness with LUX + and -.

### Feature Test

[feature_test.py](feature_test.py)

Displays some text, gradients and colours and demonstrates button use. You can adjust the brightness with LUX + and -.

### Feature Test With Audio

[feature_test_with_audio.py](feature_test_with_audio.py)

Displays some text, gradients and colours and demonstrates button use. Also demonstrates some of the audio / synth features.
- Button A plays a synth tune
- Button B plays a solo channel of the synth tune
- Button C plays a sinewave (it's frequency can be adjusted with VOL + and -)
- Button D plays a second sinewave (it's frequency can be adjusted with LUX + and -)
- Sleep button stops the sounds

### Fire Effect

[fire_effect.py](fire_effect.py)

A pretty, procedural fire effect. Switch between landscape fire and vertical fire using the A and B buttons! You can adjust the brightness with LUX + and -.

### Lava Lamp

[lava_lamp.py](lava_lamp.py)

A 70s-tastic, procedural rainbow lava lamp. You can adjust the brightness with LUX + and -.

### Nostalgia Prompt

[nostalgia_prompt.py](nostalgia_prompt.py)

A collection of copies of classic terminal styles including C64, MS-DOS, Spectrum, and more. Images and text are drawn pixel by pixel from a pattern of Os and Xs. You can adjust the brightness with LUX + and -.

### Rainbow

[rainbow.py](rainbow.py)

Some good old fashioned rainbows! You can adjust the cycling speed with A and B, stripe width with C and D, hue with VOL + and -, and the brightness with LUX + and -. The sleep button stops the animation (can be started again with A or B).

### Scrolling Text

[scrolling_text.py](scrolling_text.py)

Display scrolling wisdom, quotes or greetz. You can adjust the brightness with LUX + and -.

### Today

[today.py](today.py)

Calendar example with (optional) NTP synchronization. You can adjust the brightness with LUX + and -, and resync the date by pressing C.

## Wireless Examples

These examples need `WIFI_CONFIG.py` and `network_manager.py` (from the `common` directory) to be saved to your Pico W. Open up `WIFI_CONFIG.py` in Thonny to add your wifi details (and save it when you're done).

- [micropython/examples/common](../../examples/common)

### Cheerlights History

[cheerlights_history.py](cheerlights_history.py)

Updates one pixel every two minutes to display the most recent #Cheerlights colour. Discover the most popular colours over time, or use it as an avant garde (but colourful) 32 hour clock! Find out more about the Cheerlights API at https://cheerlights.com/

You can adjust the brightness with LUX + and -.

### Cosmic Paint

[cosmic_paint](cosmic_paint)

Draw on your Cosmic Unicorn from another device in real time, over wifi!

This example needs the `micropython-phew` and `microdot` libraries (you can install these using Thonny's 'Tools > Manage Packages').

### Exchange Ticker

[exchange_ticker.py](exchange_ticker.py)

This example uses the Coinbase open API to collect the current exchange rates of various cryptocurrencies.

Press A to change to a different base exchange currency.

### HTTP Text

[http_text](http_text)

Display scrolling wisdom, quotes or greetz... from another computer or device!

You can adjust the brightness with LUX + and -.

Requires `logging.mpy` and `tinyweb` from [micropython/examples/common](../../examples/common) - copy these into the `lib` folder on your Pico W. You'll also need `index.html` to be saved alongside `html_text.py`.

### Weather

[weather](weather)

Display current weather data from the [Open-Meteo](https://open-meteo.com/) weather API.

## NumPy examples

[numpy](numpy)

The examples in the folder use `numpy`-like array functions contained in the `ulab` library for super fast graphical effects.

## Other Examples

### Launch (Demo Reel)

[launch](launch)

If you want to get the demo reel that Cosmic Unicorn ships with back, copy the contents of this `launch` folder to your Pico W.
